# Computational-Analysis

Twitter has proved to be a great source of data for research and analysis, providing ample amount of vivid data to the researchers in various forms such as texts, videos, gifs, images, hashtags, web links etc. The code extracts tweets from the Twitter platform that involved hashtags used for the Russian-Ukrainian war. The frequencies of the hashtags is calculated and we plot them using a Word plot and a histogram. 

Based on the information gathered through the tweets, sentiment analysis can be performed on the dataset. To perform sentiment analysis and display the results using a visualization, vavrious Python libraries can be used, such as numpy, vader, pandas, text blob etc. 

Here is the link of the image of the word cloud created for the hashtags gathered from the dataset of tweets:

The results of the sentiment analysis can be visualized using a bar graph and the web link to the image of the results :
